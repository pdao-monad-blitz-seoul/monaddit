# 🏛️ Monaddit (모나딧)

> **"실명제는 의미 없다. 익명성은 지키면서 — 스테이킹이 진짜 책임을 만든다."**

## 🎯 Overview

Monaddit is a Reddit-style on-chain community platform built on Monad L1 testnet, where economic incentives ensure responsible content creation. Users stake MDT tokens (ERC-20) to post content, and malicious behavior results in slashing through community-driven moderation games. Gas fees are paid in Monad native coin, while staking, bonds, and rewards use MDT tokens.

**Key Innovation**: Hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture where content text is stored in PostgreSQL for efficiency, while content hashes are anchored on-chain for integrity and economic accountability.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🔒 Stake-based Posting**: Deposit MDT tokens (ERC-20) to create posts and comments
- **⚖️ Optimistic Moderation**: Content publishes immediately with 7-day challenge window
- **🎲 Jury System**: Commit-reveal voting by randomly selected staked moderators
- **💎 Reputation SBTs**: Non-transferable tokens tracking karma and dispute history
- **💸 Slashing Mechanism**: Economic penalties distributed 40/30/20/10 (challenger/jury/stakers/burn)
- **🏆 Staking Rewards**: Good users earn weekly rewards from 20% of slashing penalties
- **🔄 Bond Lifecycle**: Withdraw bonds after 7 days if unchallenged

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Foundry (Solidity ^0.8.x)
- **Frontend**: Scaffold-ETH 2, Next.js 15, TypeScript, React 19
- **Backend**: Rust with Axum web framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (content storage), Redis (queues/caching)
- **Web3**: Wagmi v2, Viem, RainbowKit, Alloy-rs (backend)
- **Blockchain**: Monad Testnet (EVM-compatible)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI/shadcn-ui
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Storage Strategy**:
  - Content text → PostgreSQL (off-chain)
  - Content hash → Blockchain (on-chain anchoring)
  - Evidence/snapshots → IPFS (optional)

## 🏗 Architecture

### Smart Contracts

1. **MdtToken.sol**
   - ERC-20 token with permit functionality (symbol: MDT)
   - Testnet token (tMDT) for development
   - Mint/burn functions for demo phase
   - Optional: votes extension for governance

2. **StakingVault.sol**
   - Manages user stakes and bonds (in MDT tokens)
   - Handles slashing operations
   - Enforces minimum stake requirements (10 tMDT)
   - Tracks stake age for eligibility

3. **ContentRegistry.sol**
   - Records content hash and URI (not full text)
   - Manages challenge lifecycle with 7-day window
   - Tracks content status (published/disputed/resolved)
   - Enables bond withdrawal after challenge period

4. **ModerationGame.sol**
   - Implements commit-reveal voting mechanism
   - Random jury selection from staked moderators
   - Executes verdict with reward/slashing distribution
   - Anti-griefing measures (14-day max lock, 5-day rechallenge cooldown)

5. **ReputationSBT.sol**
   - Non-transferable reputation tokens
   - Tracks karma, dispute rate, win/loss ratio
   - Influences voting weight and slashing caps
   - Determines staking reward eligibility

6. **StakingRewards.sol**
   - Accumulates 20% of slashing penalties
   - Weekly epoch distribution to eligible stakers
   - Eligibility: min stake, age, no recent violations
   - Distribution proportional to stake × reputation

7. **Treasury.sol**
   - Manages community funds and governance
   - Handles bounty payments

### Economic Model

| Parameter | Value (Testnet) | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Minimum Stake | 10 tMDT | Required to participate |
| Content Bond | 0.1 tMDT | Locked per post/comment, withdrawable after 7 days |
| Challenge Bond | 0.2 tMDT | Required to initiate dispute |
| Challenge Window | 7 days | Period for challenging content |
| Max Slashing | 20% | Per incident cap |
| Distribution | 40/30/20/10 | Challenger/Jury/StakingRewards/Burn |
| Reward Epoch | 7 days | Weekly staking rewards distribution |
| Max Lock Period | 14 days | Auto-acquittal if exceeded |
| Rechallenge Cooldown | 5 days | Prevents spam on same content |
| Acquittal Cooldown | 48 hours | Optional withdrawal delay |

## 🎮 User Flow

1. **Join**: Connect wallet → Get tMDT from faucet/mint → Stake 10 tMDT → Receive reputation SBT
2. **Post**: Create content → Backend stores text → 0.1 tMDT bond locks → Hash published on-chain
3. **Interact**: Upvote/downvote, comment, or challenge content
4. **Challenge**: Submit evidence → Auto-score from backend → Jury commit-reveal vote
5. **Resolution**:
   - **If guilty**: Bond slashed → 40% challenger, 30% jury, 20% staking pool, 10% burn
   - **If innocent**: Challenge bond slashed → Content creator compensated
6. **Bond Withdrawal**: After 7 days without challenges → Withdraw bond
7. **Staking Rewards**: Weekly distribution to eligible stakers from penalty pool

## 🧪 Testing

## 🗄️ Content Storage Architecture

### Hybrid On-chain/Off-chain Design
- **Off-chain (PostgreSQL)**: Full content text, metadata, user interactions
- **On-chain (Blockchain)**: Content hash (keccak256), URI, bonds, status
- **Benefits**: Gas efficiency, scalability, content integrity

### Content Publishing Flow
1. User writes content in frontend
2. Frontend sends text to backend `/api/content`
3. Backend stores in PostgreSQL, returns hash
4. Frontend publishes hash to `ContentRegistry` contract
5. Backend listener updates content status from chain events

## 🛡 Security Considerations

- **Commit-Reveal Voting**: Prevents vote manipulation and front-running
- **Randomized Juries**: Reduces collusion risk through random selection
- **Merkle Proofs**: Efficient and tamper-proof evidence verification
- **Time Locks**: 7-day challenge window, 14-day max lock for anti-griefing
- **Stake Age**: Sybil resistance through minimum 7-day stake age requirement
- **Content Integrity**: Off-chain storage with on-chain hash anchoring
- **Economic Security**: Slashing mechanisms create real economic consequences
- **Token Separation**: Gas fees in Monad native coin, staking/rewards in MDT token
